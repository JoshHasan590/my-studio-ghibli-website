                        <p>Born on 5<sup>th</sup> January 1941 in Tokyo, Hayao Miyazaki had always demonstrated a
                            passion for manga
                            and animation from a young age. During his school years he aspired to become a manga artist
                            and much of his early drawings were of planes, tanks and battleships as he initially
                            struggled to draw people. He destroyed most of these as he felt copying other artist’s
                            styles was preventing his own development as an artist. Later he would graduate from
                            Gakushuin University with degrees in political science and economics. During his studies, he
                            would regularly visit his middle-school art teacher; sketching and drawing manga in his
                            studio.</p>
                        <p>His interest in animation was sparked by the film Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958); Japan’s
                            first feature-length animated film in colour. He later recounted that the film left a
                            profound impression on him and that he was “moved to the depth of his soul”. Throughout his
                            decades spanning career, Hayao Miyazaki has written and directed eleven feature films, most
                            of which were produced by the company he co-founded, Studio Ghibli.</p>

                        <p>He began his professional career in 1963 at Toei Animation, working as an in-between artist.
                            This involved drawing the intermediate frames between two key frames, a process used to
                            construct the illusion of movement in classic hand-drawn animation. Within 12 months of his
                            arrival he became the chief secretary of Toei Animation’s labour union and strove to improve
                            the treatment of animators; an issue still present within the industry today.</p>
                        <p>Whilst working at Toei Animation he soon met another novice employee, aspiring director Isao
                            Takahata. During his time at Toei Animation, Miyazaki grew to work as a key animator on a
                            number of projects, most notably on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968);
                            significantly Takahata’s feature length directorial debut. This marks the beginning of long
                            and fruitful career of professional collaborations and a lifelong personal friendship
                            between the two.</p>

                            <p>Miyazaki’s breakthrough moment came with his directorial debut, The Castle of Cagliostro
                                (1979); a Lupin III film. Serving as writer, director and key animator, the film is
                                truly of Miyazaki’s making and it went on to become the most successful entry in the
                                Lupin III franchise. The changes made to the characters behaviours and personality
                                traits were initially not well received by fans of the pre-existing material. However,
                                the decision to move away from the tired and crude caricatures, towards more family
                                friendly and well-rounded character work is, somewhat ironically, considered the moment
                                Lupin “grew up”. The Castle of Cagliostro is a massively influential film; now seen as
                                an early anime classic. The detail in animation, particularly the environments and
                                backgrounds, was unrivalled at the time. The Castle of Cagliostro provides an
                                identifiable benchmark and foundation of the signature visual, story and thematic
                                styles, which would come to define Hayao Miyazaki’s career.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>In the years following The Castle of Cagliostro’s release, Hayao Miyazaki began writing
                                and illustrating a manga series titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, with the
                                first chapter releasing in 1982. Following the success of his manga, Miyazaki agreed to
                                a film adaption, on the condition that he would serve as writer, director and animator.
                                Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind would release in 1984. Although it released prior to
                                Studio Ghibli’s creation, it is retroactively considered a Ghibli film due to, not only
                                Miyazaki’s, but all of the Ghibli founders’ involvement in its production.</p>
                            <p>Set in a post-post-apocalyptic world inhabited by giant mutant insects and a vast
                                poisonous jungle, Nausicaä, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, aims to bring peace
                                between waring nations amid the toxic jungle’s constant expansion. The film released to
                                universal critical acclaim and is now often named among the best anime feature films
                                ever made; regular occurrences throughout Miyazaki’s career. Specific praise is often
                                reserved for the script, soundtrack and the titular female lead character, Nausicaä.</p>
                            <p>In 1985, a heavily edited English-dubbed adaption titled Warriors of the Wind was
                                released in the United States. This was a commercial and critical disaster. The changes
                                and edits impact the plot and heavily diluted the narrative themes of environmentalism
                                and the cost of war. Ridiculed by Miyazaki, and as a result, many of his and Studio
                                Ghibli’s films would remain “un-dubbed” and not widely released internationally until
                                the mid-1990s with Disney’s collaborations.</p>

                                third film Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986). Crucially for Ghibli in their infancy, the

                                film of the year. The film’s aesthetic is credited as a significant milestone in
                                popularising both the steampunk and dieselpunk sci-fi sub-genres.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>Miyazaki’s next film was My Neighbour Totoro (1988). The production was rather chaotic,
                                particularly for the artists, as the film was simultaneously produced alongside Isao
                                Takahata’s Grave of the Fireflies (1988). The film simply follows a father and his two
                                young daughters, Satsuki and Mei, approximately ten and four years old, moving to an old
                                rural house and their adventures with the wondrous forest spirits that live nearby; the
                                titular Totoros.</p>
                            <p>It received widespread critical acclaim and garnered a cult following due to its
                                relatively low box office return. In the years following its release, the film has
                                become something of a cultural phenomenon. The titular character Totoro is among the
                                most recognisable in all of anime, as well as becoming the official mascot and logo for
                                Studio Ghibli. It is estimated to have earned over $300m in box office and home video
                                sales to date, and over $1bn in officially licensed merchandise.</p>
                            <p>My Neighbour Totoro (1988) and Grave of the Fireflies (1988) were released theatrically
                                in Japan as a dual bill. The stark contrast between the heart-warming, wondrous Totoro
                                and the gut-wrenching, harrowing Fireflies has been described as “one of the most moving
                                and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience”.</p>

                            <p>To finish the 1980s Hayao Miyazaki released Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989). An adaption
                                of a popular novel, the film is about a thirteen year old witch, Kiki, who moves to a
                                new town and tries to earn a living through her ability to fly. It is a classic
                                coming-of-age story following our protagonist’s vulnerability and subsequent maturity.
                                The film was a massive commercial success becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in
                                1989.</p>

                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki began the 1990s with his release of Porco Rosso (1992). Miyazaki’s love of
                                aviation is on full display as the film follows a former WWI fighter pilot now working
                                as a freelance bounty hunter catching “air pirates”. However, a curse has transformed
                                him into an anthropomorphic pig. The film is one of the more mature in Miyazaki’s
                                catalogue, but this did not impact its success as it remained the highest-grossing
                                animated film in Japan for several years.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>After spending most of the mid-1990s in production, Princess Mononoke was released in
                                1997. Set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approx. 1336 – 1573 CE) the film
                                follows a young prince searching for a cure to save his life from a deadly curse. He is
                                inadvertently entangled in a war between the Gods of the forests and the mining colony
                                destroying it. One of Studio Ghibli’s most mature works, the film’s central theme is
                                environmentalism and humanity’s relationship with the natural world. Princess Mononoke
                                (1997) is considered a landmark film in the world of animation due to its breath-taking
                                visuals, epic story and morally ambiguous, well-written characters. In particular, the
                                representation of woman and people with disabilities have been singled out for praise.
                                The film was a commercial and critical blockbuster, becoming Japan’s highest-grossing
                                film of the year and breaking the box office record for a domestic film.</p>
                            <div class="quote">

                            <p>Additionally, the film is credited with greatly increasing Studio Ghibli’s popularity and
                                influence worldwide. Miramax acquired the North American distribution rights for the
                                film. As a result of the heavily edited Warriors of the Wind version of Nausicaä, Studio
                                Ghibli had enforced a strict no edits policy. When a suggestion was made to edit
                                Princess Mononoke (1997), it is rumoured that Studio Ghibli responded by sending Miramax
                                an authentic Japanese katana with the message: “No Cuts.”</p>

                            <p>Miyazaki himself had suggested Princess Mononoke (1997) would be his final film. However,
                                it was not. The story goes that while holidaying with family friends, which included
                                multiple young girls, he realised he had not created a film for ten year old girls.
                                Thus, he set out to do so. Most Japanese entertainment produced for that demographic at
                                the time revolved around childhood and teenage romance. Miyazaki felt that was not true
                                or relatable to girls of that age and wanted to create a female heroine that they could
                                look up too. This became Chihiro of Spirited Away (2001).</p>
                            <p>Spirited Away, considered by many to be Hayao Miyazaki’s magnum opus, was released in
                                2001 and has become a worldwide phenomenon. Chihiro and her parents are moving to a
                                small town in the Japanese countryside and while exploring, accidently enter the spirit
                                world. Her parents are turned into pigs by an evil witch and it is up to Chihiro to save
                                them and return to their world, before she forgets who she is.</p>
                            <p>A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Spirited Away (2001) is simply a must watch
                                film. It became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, a record held for
                                nineteen years, until 2020. It is often an international viewer’s introduction into
                                Studio Ghibli and anime as a whole. The film has won countless awards and accolades
                                worldwide, including the Japan Academy Prize for Best Film. Its international
                                recognition was sealed where it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the
                                75<sup>th</sup> Academy Awards, making the first (and only to date) hand-drawn,

                                language film to do so. Hayao Miyazaki did not attend the awards ceremony in the United
                                States. Years later Miyazaki revealed he didn’t attend the ceremony as a silent protest
                                against the United States invasion of Iraq.</p>

                                <p>“The reason I wasn’t here for the Academy Award was because I didn’t want to visit a
                                    country that was bombing Iraq. At the time, my producer shut me up and did not allow
                                    me to say that, but I don’t see him around today. By the way, my producer also

                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki’s anti-war stance was present in his next feature, Howl’s Moving Castle
                                (2004), loosely based on the novel of the same name. Set in a fictional kingdom with the
                                prevalence of magic, and against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom, Sophie, a
                                young milliner, is turned into an elderly woman by a witch. After encountering a wizard
                                named Howl, she is caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king. The most
                                recognisable element of the film is certainly the moving castle. Heavily inspired by the
                                steampunk genre, the astonishing detail and unique movement is one of Miyazaki’s finest

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>Toshio Suzuki suggested to Miyazaki to aim his next film at children. After spending time
                                at a seaside town and inspired by Hans Christian Anderson’s The Little Mermaid,
                                Miyazaki’s created Ponyo (2008). The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who
                                escapes the ocean and is rescued by a five year old boy, and her desire to become a
                                human girl. Intending to be a celebration of childhood innocence and cheerfulness, Ponyo
                                (2008) was met with, the now routine for Miyazaki, commercial success and critical
                                acclaim. During production Miyazaki decided he wanted to use only traditional animation.
                                He was heavily involved in the hand-drawn animation and the film features 170,000
                                frames, a record for Miyazaki.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki’s love for aviation has always been identifiable in his works. It is most
                                prevalent in The Wind Rises (2013). It is a fictionalised biographical film of Jiro
                                Horikoshi (1903 – 1982), a designer of fighter aircraft used by the Empire of Japan in
                                WWII.</p>
                            <div class="quote">
                                <p>Miyazaki was inspired after reading a quote of Horikoshi’s: “All I wanted to do was
                                    to make something beautiful."</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>It was intended to release simultaneously with Isao Takahata’s The Tale of the Princess
                                Kaguya (2013), but a delay in Takahata’s production meant this did not come to fruition.
                                Yet another critical and commercial success for Miyazaki, the film won the Japan Academy
                                Prize for both Animation of the Year and Best Musical Score, as well as another Academy
                                Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. Less than two months after its theatrical
                                release, Hayao Miyazaki announced his retirement from the production of feature films at
                                the age of 72. The Wind Rises (2013) has been described as a fittingly bittersweet
                                swansong for director Hayao Miyazaki.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>In 2016 Studio Ghibli released their first non-Japanese film, a co-production with French
                                company Wild Bunch, titled The Red Turtle (2016). Written and directed by Dutch animator
                                Michaël Dudok de Wit, the film tells the story of a man shipwrecked on a deserted
                                island, where he encounters a giant red sea turtle.</p>
                            <div class="quote">
                                <p>The film has no dialogue.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Reportedly, years prior Hayao Miyazaki had seen Dudok de Wit’s Academy Award winning
                                short animated film Father and Daughter (2000). Miyazaki personally contacted Dudok de
                                Wit with the offer to produce a feature film for him. Becoming one of Studio Ghibli’s
                                most critically acclaimed works and earning an Academy Award nomination for Best
                                Animated Feature, The Red Turtle (2016) is one of their most unique films.
                                Unfortunately, it did not break into the animation mainstream, but nevertheless gained
                                itself a successful cult following. A project that likely would not exist without Hayao
                                Miyazaki connecting with an aspiring animator and director, Michaël Dudok de Wit.</p>

                            <p>In 2017 it was announced that Hayao Miyazaki would come out of retirement to make another
                                feature film, titled How Do You Live? In the years since, little has been made public
                                about the film. It is known that the film is based on a 1937 novel of the same name,
                                however much like Miyazaki’s previous adaptions, the film will likely have significant
                                differences. As expected, it is being hand-drawn by Miyazaki and in 2021 it was
                                announced that approximately half the animation was complete. There is currently no
                                attached release date and although Hayao Miyazaki and producer Toshio Suzuki remain
                                tight-lipped regarding the film’s production, there is a growing belief that fans of
                                Miyazaki will not have to wait too much longer.</p>

                        <div class="film-text">
                            <p>Hayao Miyazaki has enjoyed a long and successful career at the very top of his
                                profession. He is regularly compared to Walt Disney for his role in establishing such a
                                recognisable company in Studio Ghibli. A film studio now synonymous with high-quality
                                around the world. His films can be characterised by the recurrence of themes such as
                                pacifism, environmentalism, love and friendship to name but a few. The themes and
                                meanings behind his films share and reflect his own ideals, which have no doubt
                                influenced his audiences. His narratives are notable for their encapsulating
                                atmospheres, thought-provoking stories and complex characters. In particular, his
                                progressive and positive portrayal of female characters, who contain complex and
                                individual characteristics, has led many to describe him as a feminist and his heroines
                                as role models.</p>
                            <p>Professional recognition followed Miyazaki throughout his career, leading to his films
                                amassing over 100 separate awards, as well as regularly setting and breaking various
                                worldwide and domestic records. Highlights include multiple Japan Academy Prizes and an
                                Academy Award for Spirited Away (2001) in the Best Animated Feature category.
                                Additionally, he was awarded the Academy Honorary Award in 2014 for his impact and
                                contributions to animation and cinema as a whole. In 2012, he was awarded the honour of
                                Person of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government, for outstanding cultural
                                contributions via his films.</p>

                            <p>His films shaped the future of not only animation, but filmmaking in general. A proponent
                                of classic, hand-drawn animation, he and his films continue to inspire countless
                                animators, directors and writers around the world. The jaw dropping visuals, across a
                                vast array of undeniably fantastic films, cements his legacy as quite simply, one of the
                                greatest filmmakers of all time.</p>
